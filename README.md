## Description

Minecraft 1.19.4 added the ability to swap armor / elytra in hotbar, why don't we backport this nice feature to older versions and make it even better?

Using this mod, you can not only swap the armor in your hotbar, but also swap them in your inventory by shift right-clicking.

The hotbar swap is only for version below 1.19.4 since it is a official feature after that version, but the inventory swap work for 1.19.4 as well!
